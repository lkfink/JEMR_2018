# JEMR_2018
The MATLAB and R code in this repository was used to preprocess, statistically model, and plot behavioral and eye-tracking data collected in the [Geng Lab at UC Davis](http://genglab.ucdavis.edu/). This data was published in a [Special Issue on Music & Eye-Tracking in the Journal of Eye Movement Research (JEMR)](https://bop.unibe.ch/JEMR/issue/view/793)

Fink, L.K., Hurley, B.K., Geng. J.J. & Janata, P. (2018). A linear oscillator model predicts dynamic temporal attention and pupillary entrainment to rhythmic musical patterns. *Journal of Eye Movement Research, 11*(2). 

If readers are interested in the stimulus presentation software developed for this experiment, please view [this repository](https://github.com/janatalab/attmap) on the Janata Lab Github page. The current experiment required a few extensions from the original software for communication with the eye-tracking computer. Interested readers can contact me for those Python and MAX/MSP extensions if desired. 

## Dependancies
This MATLAB code is presented for example purposes only and is not reproducable as is. This is because (1) some data are queried from the Janata Lab's MySQL server which requires authentication, and (2) some code relies on lab-general functions from our private Janata Lab repository. Interested readers can check out the [Janata Lab website](http://atonal.ucdavis.edu/resources/software/), which contains links to download a large percentage of our lab specific software, including the linear oscillator model discussed in the paper.
