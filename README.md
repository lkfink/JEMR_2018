# JEMR_2018
The MATLAB code in this repository was used to preprocess, statistically model, and plot behavioral and eye-tracking data collected in the [Geng Lab at UC Davis](http://genglab.ucdavis.edu/){:target="_blank"}. This experiment was published in the Journal of Eye Movement Research (JEMR) in a Special Issue on Music & Eye-Tracking. Read the paper [here](https://bop.unibe.ch/index.php/JEMR/index){:target="_blank"}. Full citation:

Fink, L., Hurley, B., Geng. J. & Janata, P. (2018). A linear oscillator model predicts dynamic temporal attention and pupillary sensorimotor synchronization to rhythmic musical patterns. *Journal of Eye Movement Research ?*(?), ?-??. 

If readers are interested in the experiment presentation software developed for this experiment, please view [this repository](https://github.com/janatalab/attmap){:target="_blank"} on the Janata Lab Github page. The current experiment required a few extensions from the original software for communication with the eye-tracking computer. Interested readers can contact me for those add-ons if interested. 

## Dependancies
This MATLAB code is presented for example purposes only and is not reproducable as is. This is because (1) some data are queried from the Janata Lab's MySQL server which requires authentication, and (2) some code relies on lab-general functions from our private Janata Lab repository. However, I direct interested readers to the [Janata Lab website](http://atonal.ucdavis.edu/resources/software/){:target="_blank"} which contains links to download a large percentage of our lab specific software.
